## Motorola Solutions joins local partners to deliver advanced communications network

A state-of-the-art digital communications network being rolled out in New Zealand will enable commercial organisations to reach new levels of safety and productivity. 

The network will be powered by Motorola Solutions' advanced, MOTOTRBO Capacity Max technology providing highly secure, reliable and professional two-way radio solutions that give users access to feature-rich, next-generation networks and applications. 

Modelled on a similar network established in Australia, the advanced Orion Network is being introduced to New Zealand via a partnership between long-standing radio network operators and critical communications specialists CSE Genesis, a division of CSE New Zealand Limited, and TL Parker Ltd, in association with Motorola Solutions and Orion Network Australia.

CSE New Zealand Managing Director Harry Singh says the network's partners expect total investment in the project to be several million dollars once nationwide coverage is complete. "Our industrial and critical infrastructure customers will significantly benefit from the Orion Network which is built on Motorola Solution's latest and most innovative technologies."

CSE Genesis Manager Logan Caulfield said the Orion Converged Communications Core (OC3) network would provide a suite of converged voice, data and video applications that integrate seamlessly with cellular networks. "The infrastructure for OC3 includes a nationwide trunked radio communications network that creates a bridge between narrowband and broadband data and voice services, unifying workgroups across their entire operations - regardless of the device or they carry or where they are located."

TL Parker Limited Director and Owner Garry Parker said OC3 is particularly relevant for businesses that have critical operations and infrastructures, including local authorities, utilities, ports and airports, transport and logistics operations, essential government departments and emergency services providers.

*All users of the OC3 network will have constant connections to their control room, maximising productivity, as well as providing vital safety features for workers, including GPS, telemetry, â€˜man down' and lone worker applications. For mission-critical environments, including airports and ground transport operations, this makes a big difference, especially in times of emergency when reliable connectivity enables all employees to stay safe and informed as events unfold.*

Caulfield says the network has already been rolled out in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch and will be progressively extended across the nation for completion in 2020. "It will also offer trans-Tasman connections linking with the established Orion Network in Australia, which operates across all Australian states, and will be accessible to all existing Motorola Solutions customers in New Zealand.

*That brings benefits for both countries by, for example, enabling instant and secure connection between businesses operating trans-Tasman without the high cost of cellular rates.*

General Manager of Motorola Solutions radio channel in Australia and New Zealand Dan Leppos says the new network represents a major investment from the company in New Zealand. "With New Zealand's services sectors continuing to thrive and strong employment and GPD growth forecast over coming years, advanced communications will be essential to securing the country's future prosperity.

*New Zealand's OC3 network draws on our successful partnership in delivering Australia's largest commercial digital two-way radio network, the Orion network.*

Leppos says **Motorola Solutions** has developed innovative, mission-critical solutions for enterprise and public safety customers in Australasia for 50 years and for 90 years internationally. Each year, Motorola Solutions invests around $US500 million in user-centric R&D to deliver purpose-built technology for mission-critical industries.
